# BoolFilter


This Qlik Sense Extension enables a business user to apply more complex selections. 
The entered Boolean expression is transformed to a Qlik search expression and applied as selection. 


Example use case:
- select all customers that bought Product (A AND B) AND NOT C
- select all patients that had Treatment A OR (B AND C AND NOT D)  

The prerequisite is that a 1:n or m:n relationship exists in the Qlik data model.
